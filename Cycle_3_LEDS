/*
  Interaction Indicator/Stop Light

  Cycles through 4 states turning on one LED at a time and a fourth 'Off' state.

  The circuit:
   pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V (+3.3 from Trinket)
   10 kilohm resistor attached to pin 2 from ground
    2.2 kilohm resistor attached to pin 3 from ground
     2.2 kilohm resistor attached to pin 4 from ground
     2.2 kilohm resistor attached to pin 5 from ground
   Red LED attached from pin 3 to ground
   Yellow LED attached from pin 4 to ground
   Green LED attatched from pin 5 to ground
